The api i chose to use has given me a few options to work with. i can do searches, have headlines and also have links that directly links you to the original article. 

i plan to incorporate a search bar on each of my page so you can search for a specific category of news. when entered this will redirect you to a separate page that will render all results based on your search.



Home Page
Home page will have all aggrigated news present on the the index page.
i would like to have my home page broken up into about 3 separate pages. this way i can have a certain amount of articles to displaying at a time. mainly to help with organization.
