The point of my app is to pull news from NewsApi.org. i can get information like title, description, images, and contents of each article. 

The api i chose to use has given me a few options to work with. i can do searches, have headlines and also have links that directly links you to the original article. 

I incorporated a search bar on each of my page so you can search for a specific category of news. when entered this will redirect you to a separate page that will render all results based on your search.
